      <p class="p"> We are in dire need of business angels, investors, or sponsors who would sympathize with our aims and objectives
        as echoed in our vision statement.
        
        By all means, we seek sponsorship from honourable men and women like you with the right set of skills, and connections. 
        A sponsor who is an authority figure in business, exceedingly efficient in commercial dealings in a professional capacity, to
        help expand our outreach as they(s/he) tap into the world of unending opportunity in the tech industry - particularly, Coding and Robotics.<br/><br/>
        
        On that note, we sincerely appeal to  visionaries like you, who with a honed business acumen and the desire to give back to society, is  
        motivated or impelled to empower  the younger generation with the right set of skills to help them tackle emerging, unprecedented societal problems 
         with a creative mindset. A solution-oriented mindset nurtured by exposure to design and system thinking frameworks;
        through co-ordinated activities of this coding initiative.
        
      The world is changing and in keeping pace with it, we must technically evolve with it.<br/><br/>
        
        A constructive mental mutation is needed 
        for a progressive paradigm or mindset shifts essential for the force of creative destruction.
        
        our deepest desire is to do you proud should you avail yourself of this business opportunty within the tech space of the educational sector.
        
        we assure you with utmost sincerity that your business support would greatly be appreciated and  would pay off in the stream of time.
        
        Your honest investment and contribution could reinforce your business acumen, add to your glory and, of course, fill your pocket as a creative thinker
        who is one step ahead of time.
